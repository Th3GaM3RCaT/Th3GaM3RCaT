# Th3GaM3RCaT

A computer science student focused on backend systems, databases and electronics. I treat programming and technology as a hobby — a place to experiment, learn and solve practical problems. I also enjoy retro gaming in my free time, though I keep that as a casual interest.

## About

I am a student who prefers working on backend, data and low-level systems. I enjoy designing reliable data flows, exploring database internals, and tinkering with electronics and embedded concepts. I like to learn by building small tools and experimenting with different OS environments — Linux and virtual machines are my sandbox.

My approach is practical and steady: I prefer correctness and simplicity over flashy solutions. Programming is a hobby first; I treat projects as a way to learn and to keep skills sharp.

## Skills & Tech

Below are the main technologies I use — badges link to official pages or documentation.

If you want to collaborate, discuss backend topics, or ask about database experiments — send a message. I’m open to internships, project collaborations and short consulting on database design and system reliability.
